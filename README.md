# GitGood-Forking


## What is forking, anyway?

So, you'd like to fork a repository!

First, let's quickly discuss what forking is:

Forking is the process by which you can clone a repository, including the visibility settings and all the code, but detatch it from the original ownders so that you can make changes, and push those changes as you want!

So let's go through the steps we need to take to fork a repository!

## How to Fork a Repository:

  1. Navigate to the top right of the repository, and click on the "Fork" button:

  2. From here you should see a window that displays a lot of default information. You can leave these options the same, or you can modify them to your hearts content!

  4. That's it! You've forked the repository! You now have all the code, and the commit history of that fork.
